🌱 Health & Wellness Planner Agent
Welcome to the Health & Wellness Planner Agent, an AI-powered assistant built with the OpenAI Agents SDK! This project transforms your health goals into personalized meal plans, workout routines, and progress tracking, all delivered through an engaging, real-time conversational experience. Ready to kickstart your wellness journey? Let's dive in!

🚀 Project Overview
This agent is designed to:

Personalize Plans: Generate 7-day meal plans (e.g., vegetarian) and weekly workout schedules.
Track Progress: Monitor your journey with scheduled check-ins and updates.
Stream Responses: Enjoy real-time, chatbot-like interactions.
Delegate Expertise: Hand off to specialized agents for nutrition, injuries, or human coaching.

Built with modularity and scalability in mind, this project mimics a real-world AI wellness assistant.

🎯 Features

Agent + Tool Creation: Core functionality with async tools like MealPlannerTool and WorkoutRecommenderTool.
State Management: Persistent context via UserSessionContext.
Guardrails: Input/output validation for safe and structured responses.
Real-Time Streaming: Live updates using Runner.stream().
Handoffs: Seamless transitions to NutritionExpertAgent, InjurySupportAgent, or EscalationAgent.
(Optional) Lifecycle Hooks: Logging and debugging with RunHooks and AgentHooks.
